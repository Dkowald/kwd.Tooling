# Overview
Various .NET Core templates to assist development.  
These as specialized to my own needs, so may not have general usage.  

They can be used as-is; or as further dotnet new template examples.

See [wiki](https://github.com/Dkowald/kwd.Tooling/wiki) for more details

## Included templates:

- Create a razor component, or razor-fluxor component,  
    including backing cs and css files
> dotnet new __razorpart__  
> dotnet new __fluxpart__

- A markdown file; contains some starter help and links for reference
> dotnet new __md__

- Create a DataString class, useful to provide a type-safe alternate to a raw string  
  see [kwd.CorUtil](https://github.com/Dkowald/kwd.CoreUtil)
> dotnet new __datastring__

- A SDK Traversal project.  
 Usefull as a build project; though I mostly use it to avoid solution folders in visual studio.
> dotnet new __cibuild__
